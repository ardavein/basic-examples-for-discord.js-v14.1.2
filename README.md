Hello everyone, i made an example of a bot with discord.js v14,
If you want to support me, you can add this bot to your server -> https://bit.ly/3vv7l0i
SOME TIPS: 
Don't try to install 'discord-api-types' module like this:
"npm i discord-api-types/v9"
Instead, try this
"npm i discord-api-types"
it'll install everything in the module.
